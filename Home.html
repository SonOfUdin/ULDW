<p id="Objective">Welcome to the webpage of the 2022 Urhobo Language Development workshop. ULDW is an annual workshop organised by the 
	Urhobo Studies Association (USA), Delta State University, Abraka, through supports from spirited individuals and 
	organisarions. The workshop aims to bring together Urhobo language teachers, enthusiasts and activists from across 
	Delta Central and beyond to network  and discuss on how to develop the Urhobo language for use in education 
	(either as a medium of instruction or as a subject of study). Thus, the goals of the workshop includes:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>To promote discussions on revitalisation, growth and development of the Urhobo language,
		and language inclusion in all spheres of communication. </li>
		<li>To create a movement for cooperation with the aim of identifying strategies to accelerate the teaching and learning of Urhobo. </li>
		<li>To enhance Urhobo language teaching, learning, acquisition, and research.</li>
	</ol> 
<p id="Objective">
This year's event (#ULDW22) which is both in-person and online seeks to address the twin issues of
Urhobo writing system and scheme of work for teaching the Urhobo language in basic schools. Details about online participation can be found below.

<h3>SYNOPSIS OF PLENARIES</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Phonological issues in Urhobo Orthography Design</b> 
	<br>Vowel elision, glide formation, the dual behavior of /e, o/, tone, and other phonological phenomena
	have implications for Urhobo orthography. One of the vowels in a sequence,
	especially the ﬁrst, gets deleted if it is not a high vowel (abo#emuo > abemuo
	‘wrestling’); but becomes a glide if it is a high vowel (ikũ#esiri > ikwesiri
	'goodnews'). ‘e’ & ‘o’ behave sometimes as non-high vowels (get deleted as in
	se#ọbe > sọbe ‘read book‘) or as high vowels (realized as glide as in re#ọne >
	rjọne ‘eat yam‘). Tone plays both lexical and functional roles in Urhobo, like
	distinguishing the meaning of words as in òdẹ̀ 'name' vs ódẹ̀ ‘yesterday’; or
	marking some grammatical categories such as tenseiaspect (mì sí wé ‘i pulled
	you‘ vs mǐ sí wé ‘i am pulling you‘). Phonetic vowel length (mǐ sí wé ‘i am pulling
	you‘) & contrastive nasal vowel also play a role in Urhobo. These phenomena
	can have an effect on ﬂuent reading, word identiﬁcation, and ambiguity; thus,
	this forum will address them, with special emphasis on the following: (a) should
	elided vowels be omitted? (this can improve ﬂuency but hinders word
	identiﬁcation & disambiguation as in de#ame ‘buy water‘ vs da#ame ‘drink
	water’ in dame; (b) should instance of ‘e/o’ as low vowels be represented
	differently from ‘e/o’ as high vowels?; (c) should tone be partlyiﬁllly marked or
	unmarked‘? if marked, how?; (d) should only basic tone be marked?; etc.
	</li>
<br>

<li><b>Morphological/Syntactic issues in Urhobo Orthography Design</b> 
	<br> This forum will discuss morphological issues which can have an impact on Urhobo
	orthography design, including word division, compounding, afﬁxation (in
	relation to ATR harmony) and the representation of grammatieal categories
	such as clitic, tense, aspect, etc. These phenomena can also impact on ﬂuent reading,
	word identiﬁcation, & ambiguity. Thus, these issues will be addressed, with
	particular focus on the following: (a) how should compound words be
	represented? hyphenated? (b) what word division principle should be adopted‘?
	(c) how should different grammatical categories be marked‘?, etc. There is also a
	pulse break in Urhobo utterances involving the use of ‘e’ such as Otiti chere emu
	vs Otiti chere emu. How should this be represented (with the pulse marker or
	word should be wholly represented)?</li>
<br>
<li><b>How Should We Write Loanwords in Urhobo</b>: 
	<br>Words are often modified
	when borrowed, especially when they are not "compatible" with the phonology
	of the borrowing language. According to Hosken (2003), one of the hardest
	issues an orthography has to deal with is how to spell words which are imported
	from another language. Do the words keep their original spelling or are they
	spelled according to how they sound when spoken in the language we are
	describing? This forum therefore seeks to not only answer this question but also
	proffer ideas on how to represent the different modifications, such as sound
	modification, vowel insertion, non-ﬁnal coda deletion (with particular focus on
	nasal coda), etc.</li>
	<br>
<li><b>Scheme of Work for Basic Education in Urhobo:</b> 
	<br>A scheme of work's
	primary purpose is to assist teachers in proactively planning and sequencing
	their classes. By doing so, they can guarantee that the curriculum objectives are
	met and that all course material is taught before the school year closes. Thus,
	having developed a curriculum for the Urhobo language, it is also essential to
	chart a path on how to work out a scheme of work from the curriculum.
	</li>
	<br>
<li><b>Teaching Urhobo to Learners with English Background:</b> 
	<br>Most students
	learning Urhobo already have some level of literacy in English. Thus, they come
	into the Urhobo learning environment with this background, which can be
	harnessed to strengthen their learning experiences. The discussion in this forum
	will thus revolve around how such a background can be optimally utilized in
	teaching the various topics and achieving learning objectives.
	</li>
<br>
<li><b>Issues in Urhobo Language Testing and Assessment: </b>
	<br>Testing is a
	broad category of testing that assesses aspects of a person's ability to understand
	or communicate in a particular language. This forum will discuss how to best
	assess students taking Urhobo in basic schools, bearing in mind that the recent
	Delta State Basic Education Certificate Examination on the Urhobo language is
	characterized by criticisms, centred mainly on the content of the examination.
